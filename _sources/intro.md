This is the main landing page of the [**basics** project].

The project will be first developed in Italian, at least for material targeting high-schools. Please, rely on the translator of your browser, or have a little patience waiting for translation, or - even better - feel free to contribute through [Github repos](https://github.com/Basics2022).

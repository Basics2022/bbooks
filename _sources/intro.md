# basics books

This is the main landing page of the **basics** project.

The project will be first developed in Italian, at least for material targeting high-schools. Please, rely on the translator of your browser, or have a little patience waiting for translation, or - even better - feel free to contribute through [Github repos](https://github.com/Basics2022).

Material for university is likely to be a jupyter-book version of some hand-written notes already available at [https://basics.altervista.org](https://basics.altervista.org).

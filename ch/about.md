**Jupyter books for interactive open textbooks at TUDelft.**
On the 2024 Nov 13, I've found out that some people working at TUDelft are using the same approach for building an open textbook project, hosted on Gitlab, collecting books for university. I'm sure I'll find some useful tips for this project, either in their manual or [demonstration with Jupyter books](https://interactivetextbooks.tudelft.nl/open-textbooks-demonstration/intro.html), or browsing in their [repo](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/opentextbooks).
Maybe I'll contact them in the future, as soon as I have an English version of these documents.

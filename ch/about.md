**2024 Nov 13 - Jupyter books for interactive open textbooks at TUDelft.**
On the 2024 Nov 13, I've found out that some people working at TUDelft are using the same approach for building an open textbook project, hosted on **Gitlab**, collecting books for university. I'm sure I'll find some useful tips for this project, either in their manual or [demonstration with Jupyter books](https://interactivetextbooks.tudelft.nl/open-textbooks-demonstration/index.html), or browsing in their [repo](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/opentextbooks).
Maybe I'll contact them in the future, as soon as I have an English version of these documents.

- Should I move the project from Github to Gitlab? Why did I choose Github over Gitlab? I suspect there was some good reason to make this choice - that I'd have never done otherwise - but I can't remember why...
